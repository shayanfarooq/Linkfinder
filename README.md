Welcome to  Link Extractor! üåêüîç This Go script is designed to scan JavaScript files and extract URLs and paths embedded within. It's a powerful tool for developers and security analysts looking to identify external resources referenced in JavaScript code.

Features
Comprehensive URL Extraction:
Extracts relative URLs, paths, and absolute URLs.
Identifies URLs from fetch API calls.
Uses advanced regex patterns to catch a wide variety of URL formats.
Color-Coded Output:
Green for URL headers
Cyan for extracted URLs
Usage
From Command-Line Arguments
Provide a URL directly as a command-line argument:
```
go run main.go https://example.com/script.js
```
From Standard Input
If no URL is provided, the script will read from standard input. Pipe or type a URL into the script:

```
echo "https://example.com/script.js" | go run main.go
```
